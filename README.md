# bioclub.org Legacy Content

The content of the legacy site [bioclub.org](www.bioclub.org) has be scraped with `wget` to create an archival copy. The goal is to re-upload the content to the new [bioclub.tokyo](https://www.bioclub.tokyo) website.


## Progress

To do:
- [x] Fix paths
- [x] Upload the content of the old site temporarily to [legacy.bioclub.tokyo](https://legacy.bioclub.tokyo), to help with the manual importing of the old content.
- [x] [legacy.bioclub.tokyo](https://legacy.bioclub.tokyo) is now under `.htaccess`, disencouraging search engines to index the site. Please go to Discord `#website` for access info.



## Q & A

#### How can I help?
Join the BioClub Discord, submit account request form to make an account at [bioclub.tokyo](https://www.bioclub.tokyo) at start uploading the content!

#### Would it be easier/faster to make a script to automatically imports the old content?
If we would have access to the orginal DB, but that's not the case. Also not all the content is bi-ligual.
